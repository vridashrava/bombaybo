Kanav's school starts tomorrow but his mother is not ready to let him have
anything coming from his father. He has been taken away to Rourkela away from
any kind of schooling he can get here in Bangalore. I am not sure what's going
on in her mind, except for a clear desire to keep things in a limbo. Terribly
heartless to the kid and ofcourse a father.

Kanchan again does not show up in the court, third time in a row. Looks like
the tactics to dodge the restitution petition that I have filed. She clearly
does not want to come back and is also not ready to separate out peacefully.
She has stone walled all attempts of mine to meet or talk to my son for last
one year and has succeeded in keeping him away from good schooling in this
process. His admissions in Oakridge are done and the school starts on 7th June,
2017. When she did not turn up at the court today, I went and checked at her
house and found that the apartment is locked up and vacated. She was
apparentely back last week in Bangalore to pack her stuff (And probably drop at
a friend's place).One of the neighbour's kids though when asked said Kanav has
gone to Orissa and will come back after a month, when they'll move to a new
house.
